To utilize this, ensure that you adhere to the instructions below:

You will need a Yolov7 model that has been trained (or you may also use the official pre-trained Yolov7 models), which can be acquired by downloading them from this location.

After downloading the files, proceed to the subsequent step. This web application's feature is that it does not require a specific model name because I have included code to directly search for the model file within this directory (so no modifications are necessary, and you can run it as is). However, please take note that only one model file should be placed in your directory at a time, or else the code will not function correctly. The green bar on top of the page will indicate which model is being used for inference on your machine.
